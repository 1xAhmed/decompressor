### Solidity contract that only has one function

```bash
function decompress(bytes calldata data) returns (memory bytes) { ... }
```
Solidity contract that only has one function that accepts compressed blob of bytes and returns uncompressed ETH-ABI-encoded version of the original message.

**The goal is to be able to submit big chunks of data to the smart contract (without storing it, only processing) in a compressed version due to limits of Ethereum blockchain which has maximum of only 128 KB per transaction.
The decompression algorithm should be fast and cheap and compress the data enough so it can be submitted to the contract (no deep compression is required).**

**the data the contract is receiving in the function should be decompressed and then decoded using abi.decode. The goal is to implement the compression/decompression algorithm. Compression can be done off-chain
Any library can be used, but the decompression must be efficient**

Example of an uncompressed data ETH-ABI encoded data:

This function should accept a compressed blob of bytes and return the uncompressed ETH-ABI-encoded version of the original message. The goal is to efficiently handle large chunks of data in a compressed form due to Ethereumâ€™s transaction size constraints (128 KB max). A fast and cost-effective decompression approach is desired.

Example data and hints are provided in the instructions. Pay attention to the message structure and the pattern of percentage zeroes.
